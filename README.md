## About

Norris is a showcase for modern and well-crafted Android code. 

Here you will find a codebase powered by tests in all semantic levels (unit, integration, acceptance) as well an architectural design that promotes discipline over state, using Kotlin Coroutines + Kotlin Flows as foundation for a pragmatic unidirectional dataflow implementation.

## Project Overview

This project leverages on [api.chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/) as remote data source to implement the following use cases

- User can search for Chuck Norris facts and share them
- Application will offer suggestions of searches
- Application also remembers terms searched by the user

## Implementation Highlights

- **OkHttp** + **Retrofit** for networking
- **Kotlinx.Serialization** for Json handling
- **Kotlinx.Coroutines** for asynchrounous processing
- Unidirectional data-flow driven by **Kotlin Flows**
- Manual dependencies/instances management at runtime driven by **Kodein**
- No annotations processors (therefore no `kapt`)
- No Fragments

## Modularisation Highlights

The code is structured in a multi-module fashion, with semantics of high-level modules (under `features`) packaging high-level pieces of funcionality (including UI details) while low-level modules (or `platform` ones) provide required infrastructure for features, like networking, storage and so on. The final product is packaged on top of the `app` module.

## Testing Strategy

This project is **heavily opinionated** on how testing should be done in modern Android projects. Particularly, I follow here the approach proposed by [Kent Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests) as much as possible:

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration

approaching the concept of a [honeycomb of tests](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2018/01/11/testing-of-microservices/) the most I can.

In a nutshell :

- No mocks are used, only fakes when needed. This project does not use libraries like Mockito or Mockk.
- Most of unit tests actually are on `platform` modules, since these modules provide the core functionally for features
- [Table-driven testing](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests) is used whenever possible
- [Interaction-based tests are completely avoided](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/02/18/from-interaction-based-to-state-based-testing/); only state-based tests are used
- On `features`, tests are mandatory over data sources, although REST APIs are not directly faked; instead, we test the whole networking stack by inject fake responses on a Mock Server
- When a high level module owns some domain logic of interest - eg, some validation rule - such logic is unit tested
- No unit test over ViewModels
- Also on `features`, integrated tests run at Activity level by leveraging a pragmatic way to decoupling this platform controller from its hosted Views : the inflated View is faked at testing time. Tests run on top of Robolectric over Activity Scenarios.
- In addition to that, on `features` we test the View layer via [screenshot tests](https://medium.com/definitylabs/what-is-screenshot-testing-43981023cdff) in a fully isolated way. I understand that **screenshot tests are not the same and should not be used as acceptance tests**.
- [Acceptance tests](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=186) are implemented with Espresso running over Android/Instrumentation     
- **Acceptance tests** exercise the **release artefact**, approaching what will be shipped to users/customers; the only exception here is the REST API URL passed-in at build time (for the sake of controlling testing conditions)
- In addition to that, **acceptance tests** exercise real user flows in a cross-screen / cross-feature fashion and running with a stress-first approach (2 runs per execution x 2 Jobs per run on CI)

Actual numbers:

Testing approach   | Execution Environment                            | Amount   | Percentage   |
-------------------| -------------------------------------------------| -------- | ------------ |
Unit tests         | JVM-only                                         | 11       | ~ 32%        |
Integration tests  | JVM-only + Robolectric + Android/Instrumentation | 21       | ~ 62%        |
Acceptance tests   | Android/Instrumentation                          | 2        | ~ 6%         |

## Building and Running

If you want a simple run over some task of the CI pipeline, just use the companion script

```
./scripts/ci-tasks.sh
```

so you can chose between :

- Run static analysers ([Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) and [Detekt](https://arturbosch.github.io/detekt/))
- Run all unit/integration tests over JVM
- Run all screenshot tests over Android/Instrumentation
- Run acceptance tests over with Espresso

Please note that an online device is required in order to run screenshot/acceptance tests .
I recommend `api-28/google-apis` with `pixel` device profile as the your AVD configuration for that (the same used on CI).

Also note that local builds **require JDK11**, since this project compiles against Java11 bytecode.

In addition to that, this project requires [latest stable release of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases), ie, 7.x.z (Artic Fox) or newer.
