## About

Norris is a showcase for modern and well-crafted Android code. 

Here you will find a codebase powered by tests in all semantic levels (unit, integration, acceptance) as well an architectural design that promotes discipline over state, using Kotlin Coroutines + Kotlin Flows as foundation for a pragmatic unidirectional dataflow implementation.

## Project Overview

This project leverages on [api.chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/) as remote data source to implement the following use cases

- User can search for Chuck Norris facts and share them
- Application will offer suggestions of searches
- Application also remembers terms searched by the user

The code is structured in a multi-module fashion, with semantics of high-level modules (under `features`) packaging high-level pieces of funcionality (including UI details) while low-level modules (or `platform` ones) provide required infrastructure for features, like networking, storage and so on.


## Building and Running

If you want a simple run emulating the PR pipeline, just use the companion script

```
./scripts/emulate-pr-build.sh
```

It will

- Run static analysers ([Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) and [Detekt](https://arturbosch.github.io/detekt/))
- Run all unit/integration tests over JVM
- Assemble the `release` APK
- Run Espresso tests over Android/Instrumentation

Please note that an online emulator is required in order to run this script sucessfully.

## Implementation highlights

- **OkHttp** + **Retrofit** for networking
- **Kotlinx.Serialization** for Json handling
- **Kotlinx.Coroutines** for asynchrounous processing
- Unidirectional data-flow driven by **Kotlin Flows**
- Semi-manual dependencies/instances management at runtime driven by **Kodein**
- No annotations processors (therefore no `kapt`)
- No Fragments

## Testing Strategy

This project is **heavily opinionated** on how testing should be done in modern Android projects. Particularly, I follow here the approach proposed by [Kent Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests) as much as possible:

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration

In practice, in this project:

- No mocks are used, only fakes when needed. That's correct, this project does not use Mockito or Mockk.
- Most of unit tests actually are on `platform` modules, since those libraries provide core functionally for features
- [Table-driven testing](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests) is used whenever possible
- [Interaction-based tests are completely avoided](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/02/18/from-interaction-based-to-state-based-testing/); only state-based tests are used
- On `features`, tests are mandatory over data sources, although REST APIs are not directly faked; instead, we test the whole networking stack by inject fake responses on a Mock Server
- When a high level module owns some domain logic of interest - eg, some validation rule - such logic is unit tested
- Also on `features`, integrated tests run over Activities by leveraging a pragmatic way to decoupling them from their hosted Views. The inflated View is faked at testing time. 
- No unit test over ViewModels
- [Acceptance tests](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=186) are implemented with Espresso running over Android/Instrumentation     
- Espresso tests exercise the **release artefact**; the only difference when compared with a production-ready APK is the REST API URL passed-in at build time
- Acceptance tests run with a stress-first approach (5 runs per execution x 3 Jobs per run on CI)
- Acceptance tests exercise real user flows in a cross-screen / cross-feature fashion

Actual numbers:

Testing approach   | Execution Environment           | Amount   | Percentage |
-------------------| ------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
Unit tests         | JVM/plain                       | 11       | 39%        |
Integration tests  | JVM/plain + JVM/Instrumentation | 15       | 54%        |
Acceptance tests   | Android/Instrumentation         | 2        | 7%         |
