## About

Norris is a small and non-trivial Android project used as

- a showcase for some advanced techniques regarding infrastructure for large Android projects
- a sandbox for testing new tools in the open

This project leverages on [api.chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/) as remote data source to implement 
the following use cases

- User can search for Chuck Norris facts and share them
- Application will offer suggestions of searches
- Application also remembers terms searched by the user
