## About

Norris is a showcase for modern and well-crafted Android code. 

Here you will find a codebase powered by tests in all semantic levels (unit, integration, acceptance) as well an architectural design that promotes discipline over state, using Kotlin Coroutines + Kotlin Flows as foundation for a pragmatic unidirectional dataflow implementation.

## Project Overview

This project leverages on [api.chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/) as remote data source to implement the following use cases

- User can search for Chuck Norris facts and share them
- Application will offer suggestions of searches
- Application also remembers terms searched by the user

The code is structured in a multi-module fashion, with semantics of high-level modules (under `features`) packaging high-level pieces of funcionality (including UI details) while low-level modules (or `platform` ones) provide required infrastructure for features, like networking, storage and so on.


## Building and Running

If you want a simple run emulating the PR pipeline, just use the companion script

```
./scripts/emulate-pr-build.sh
```

It will

- Run static analysers ([Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) and [Detekt](https://arturbosch.github.io/detekt/))
- Run all unit tests
- Assemble the `release` APK
- Run Espresso tests

Please note that an online emulator is required in order to run this script sucessfully.

## Testing Strategy

This project is **heavily opinionated** on how testing should be done in modern Android projects. Particularly, I follow here the approach proposed by [Kent Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests) as much as possible:

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration

In practice, we have

- No mocks are used, only fakes (when needed). This project does not use Mockito.
- Most of unit tests actually are on `platform` modules, since those libraries provide core functionally for features
- On features, tests are mandatory over data sources, although REST APIs should not be directly faked; instead, we test the whole networking stack by inject fake responses through it
- When a feature has some domain logic of interest - eg, some validation logic over data - such logic is unit tested
- Also on features, integrated tests run over over Activities by leveraging a pragmatic way to decoupling it from the underlying View and asserting data flows in the desired directions (either from data source to screen or from screen to data sources)
- This means that we don't unit test ViewModels
- Espresso tests ensure cross-screen user journeys and run against the release variant of the application
